Done:
- Alpha sorting:
renderables (didnt use structure seen in the lesson - done using the alredy existing Node class with slight modifications since it alredy contains the data needed)
alpha elements rendered last and sorted by distance

- Phong: 
ambient light
point light
directional light
spot light (TODO)
ranged attenuation

- Several lights: 
single pass
multi pass (some inconsistencies in directional lights)
frustum culling (TODO, test if sphere overlaps with bounding boxes and camera BoundingBoxSphereOverlap)


(new) Render options:
- Multipass lights		
Render lights using single pass or multi pass implementation.
- Render with lights		
Activate lab 1 implementation.
